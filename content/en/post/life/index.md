Burundi is a Central African country
which covers an area of 27,834 km2
of which 25,200 terrestrial. It is a country where
Agriculture employs 90% of the population. The objectives for the protection of
the environment are essential and pass
inevitably through education about
the environment (ErE).
We believe, however, that traditionally the people
of Burundi had customs aimed at preserving its
environment and that it was developing in this respect a certain
number of values. It seems to us that it is essential
revalorise traditional knowledge and practices in order to
any action in EWE in Burundi. It is to be feared, indeed,
that in contact with other cultures, certain elements of the
Burundian culture have faded.
It also seems that education on
the environment can spread thanks to the action of the
women who have a key role in the education of children and
Burundi.
Traditional Burundian education
In ancient Burundi, children were educated for the
function or position held by their parents.

became a hunter. Mothers and fathers took care of the
respectively of their boys and girls in order to
teach them a trade.
Moral values were of considerable importance,
Examples include the Ubuntu, the Ubushingantahe, a male

justice-loving. In short, a man who is a reference for
its environment.

Certain practices were conveyed through taboos and prohibitions.
For example, it was prescribed to respect forests and sacred animals and
that by this obligation, the forests were preserved.
The contact of the Burundian culture with other cultures
With colonisation, traditional habits were abandoned in the
taking advantage of modern practices.
In parallel with a more or less tenacious traditionalism, there is a
new trend towards synthesis between the existing culture and the new
new influences, sometimes even towards an almost total abandonment of the
ancestral heritage. (Manirambona, 1997, p. 11).
Some research (e.g. Bigawa et al., 2000) concludes that
that plants and animals once respected are no longer respected. Some species
are threatened with extinction. Currently, the traditional way of
conservation of biodiversity, which was achieved through the "in situ" existence of
Sacred groves and sacred animals tend to disappear. A more rational mode
of "ex-situ" conservation is manifested in the form of sacred woods, groves

in an enclosure.
It seems urgent to us to revalorise certain practices or beliefs
for the respect of the environment. We will take up here some
examples of local practices for the protection of fauna and flora and the
flora.
The fauna
Wildlife held a considerable place in Burundian culture. Some
animals were highly respected for their beauty and their role in society.
This is the case of the cow (inka). In addition to its dietary and medical role, it
intervenes in the weaving and consolidation of family ties since it
is a basis for the dowry at the wedding. Panthera leopard skin
pardus serves as a costume for the dancers. Some birds (the ombrette or
the Dominican widow, for example) as well as the leopard, the hare, the python,
etc. were used in traditional medicine.
Through education, mothers prohibited children from killing animals.
For example, it was forbidden to kill the lizard. The Barundi used to say: Wishe
umuserebanyi, nyoko aca acika amabere (if you kill the lizard, your mummy will lose the lizard)
her breasts). Nobody dared to kill the widowed African wagtail for free,

(Imana). There were animals of good omen and others of bad omen.
For example, our ancestors believed that the cry of an owl predicted the death of an

ico yabitse (you can kill the rooster, but you can't kill what it predicted). This
was a kind of ploy to avoid killing these people.
animals that heralded unfortunate events.
The Ox Heron, Bulbucus ibis - inyange, is praised for its beauty in
songs and tales. It is a bird that has a lot of importance especially
for breeders. "Given the importance that the Inyange had in our culture, the
killing was a cr
